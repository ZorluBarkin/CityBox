# CityBox
A relaxing 3D city building game where there are no monetary constraints and so on... The main point is to make a city that is beautiful and manage traffic

Note: the terrain has position of x = 0.5, y = -0.5, z = 0.5, this is done so that placing objects on the gameworld can be done via pos: 1, 0, 1 referencing a 1x1 Cube.
